So you want a low cost mech keeb...
Your wish has been granted.

Danck - The hella low cost planck.
Just a PCB and a bottom plate, the bare minimum for a functional keyboard.

Features:
- 2U or split space.
- All through-hole parts. 48x diodes, 1x Pro Micro.
- Assembled by M2 standoffs and screws.
- Programmable via QMK.
- Nothing fancy. A very nice way to try out some switches, enjoy some DIY, or to test out ortho keyboards.
